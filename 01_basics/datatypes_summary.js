//  Datatypes classified into two categories 1 primitive 2 non-primitive
// primitive datatypes are those who are called by value.. i.e the changes are made in teh copy and not at the original address of that value
// 1.string 2.Number 3.Boolean 4.Null
//non-primitive are those which can be called by reference
// 1.array 2.objects 3.functions
//JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.
//You don’t need to declare a variable’s type.
//The type is determined at runtime based on the value assigned.
//You can change the type of a variable later in the code.
